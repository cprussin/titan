/**
 * Base styles shared by the Input, Textarea, and Select wrapper divs. The
 * `:has()` selectors below let the wrapper restyle itself based on the
 * *control* inside it (the `<input>` / `<textarea>` / Select trigger
 * marked with `data-control=""`) without the React tree having to mirror
 * that state.
 *
 * Every state selector is scoped to `[data-control]` (never bare
 * `:has(:disabled)` / `:has(:focus-visible)` / etc.) so that buttons or
 * other interactive descendants — most notably the trailing-group's
 * `suffixButtons` — don't bleed their own state into the wrapper. A
 * disabled Send button must not grey out the textarea.
 *
 * The control coordinates with three companion data-attributes that
 * `PrefixIconStack` sets:
 *   - `data-prefix-stack`     — outer span when an icon prefix is provided;
 *                               its children animate to swap the icon for an
 *                               invalid indicator when the control is invalid
 *   - `data-prefix-decoration`— the icon child (animates *down* and out)
 *   - `data-prefix-invalid`   — the invalid indicator child (animates *in*)
 *   - `data-prefix-standalone`— outer span when there is no icon prefix;
 *                               slides an invalid indicator in horizontally
 *
 * State matrix the selectors below cover (axes ordered by specificity):
 *
 *   disabled  → backgroundColor:card, opacity:disabled, cursor:not-allowed
 *   invalid   → borderColor:dangerSoft, prefix-icon swap animation
 *   focused   → outlineColor:accent (or danger if also invalid),
 *               borderColor:accent (skipped when invalid — the
 *               danger border + danger outline already carry that
 *               signal), color:foreground. The "focused" axis matches three
 *               signals on the control, any of which keeps the wrapper
 *               looking focused:
 *                 - `:focus`             — the control owns DOM focus.
 *                                          Matches `:focus` (not
 *                                          `:focus-visible`) so a mouse
 *                                          click into the control
 *                                          immediately lights the
 *                                          accent outline.
 *                 - `[data-popup-open]`  — base-ui sets this on the
 *                                          Select trigger while its
 *                                          popup is open. Focus is
 *                                          inside the portaled popup,
 *                                          so `:focus` is gone but the
 *                                          attribute keeps the wrapper
 *                                          looking focused.
 *                 - `[data-active]`      — set by Select (and only
 *                                          Select) for the *entire*
 *                                          open lifecycle: opened on
 *                                          `onOpenChange(true)`,
 *                                          cleared on
 *                                          `onOpenChangeComplete(false)`
 *                                          after the close animation
 *                                          and refocus complete. Bridges
 *                                          the otherwise-visible gap
 *                                          between `[data-popup-open]`
 *                                          being removed and `:focus`
 *                                          landing on the trigger, so
 *                                          there is no transient
 *                                          unfocused frame to fade.
 *   hovered   → borderColor:muted (or danger if also invalid)
 *
 * The "hovered" axis also matches when the inner control carries
 * `data-resizing` (set by `ResizeHandle` during a drag) so the wrapper
 * keeps its hover border for the duration of the drag even after the
 * pointer leaves the wrapper. The resize handle itself is also styled to
 * its hover color via a descendant rule on `[data-resize-handle]`.
 *
 * Each more-specific axis takes precedence; the `:not(...)` chains ensure
 * the less-specific rules don't apply when a more-specific one would.
 *
 * This is published as a `css(...)` className (not a plain style object)
 * so Panda's static extractor sees every literal selector and property at
 * the call site here. Consuming the const as `cva({ base: wrapperBase })`
 * in Input/Textarea was opaque to the extractor — the cross-file const
 * reference produced classes with no CSS rules in the bundle, which is
 * why hover and focus styles silently stopped applying.
